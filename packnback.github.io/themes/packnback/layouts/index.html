					This site is the home of a <b>work in progress</b> backup tool called packnback.
				</p>

				<p>
					To understand the rationale of the project, see the <a href="/blog/work_begins/"> introductory post</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					To follow along with design and development progress, simply read this site where
					we aim to post updates on design and implementation progress that people
					may be interested in.
				</p>

				<p>
					To access the source code see it on <a href="https://github.com/packnback">github</a>.
					remember this project is just starting, so there is not much to see yet.
				</p>

				<p>
					To contact us see the <a href="/contact/">contact page</a>.
				</p>

				This project relies on sponsors and donations to survive, consider <a href="/donate/">donating</a>.

				<p>
					P.S. As you can tell, we need someone who understands website design (hugo static site) to help fix things up ... and we need a logo :).
