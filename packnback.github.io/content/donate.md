Remember, this project needs you to survive, consider sponsoring it and it's development. 
Donated Funds will be used to pay for server infrastructure as well as services to advance the project. Funds may also be allocated at the discretion of the account owner to pay developers contributing to the project.

Only send a donation if you understand that donations don't guarantee project success,
they are not a binding contract, but may increase the chances of success.
